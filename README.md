# WeeBuddy 🐶

### What's Entailed?

👉 WeeBuddy is a web app that is based around the traditional CRUD functionality. Users are about to **Create**, **Read**, **Update**, and **Delete** their logs all thanks to the implementation of Firebase and NextAuth. Users log in and create logs with a required title and optional notes and/or image.
